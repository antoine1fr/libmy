Introduction:
Libmy is a library I have coded during my 3 first weeks at Epitech.
I use it in my everyday-projects at school so bug fixing and new feature adding are
done on the fly.

Compilation:
Simply execute make in the root directory. Compilation has been tested on GNU/Linux
and FreeBSD. It should compile on many unix systems because it only uses a very few
functions of the system (write, malloc, free).
